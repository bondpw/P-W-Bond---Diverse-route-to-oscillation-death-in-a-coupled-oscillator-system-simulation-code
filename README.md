# P-W-Bond---Diverse-route-to-oscillation-death-in-a-coupled-oscillator-system-simulation-code
This is the code used to study the properties of the model from the paper  Diverse route to oscillation death in a coupled oscillator system simulation code

SimulationV102_DefUpdate: this file defines the parameters and equations of the system. It also defines the Runge-Kutta update method

SimulationV102_Process: this file impliments the Runge-Kutta update method

SimulationV102_Simulation: this file defines the parameters of the simulation, as well as the timestep and number of iterations that will be completed.

SimulationV102_Analysis: this file plots the data from the simulation.
